Install Dependencies and Build
Run the following commands in your terminal:

#bash
npm init -y
npm install @wordpress/scripts --save-dev
npx wp-scripts build

This will compile your JavaScript into a dist directory.

Final Step: Activate the Plugin
Go to your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to the Plugins page, and activate your new Toshiba Marketing Form Block plugin.

Now you have a Toshiba Marketing Form block that you can use in the Gutenberg editor. The form includes fields for name and email, and a submit button. You can further extend the functionality and styling as needed.
